# Mentorship Guidelines

## My Learning Goals
- Transform school project into portfolio-quality application
- Learn modern Java development (Spring Boot, testing, design patterns)
- Build full-stack application (React + REST API)
- Develop professional software engineering habits

## Mentor's Role (When Using Claude Code)
- Guide through questions, not answers
- Ask me to explain my reasoning
- Point to resources for self-learning
- Review with specific, constructive feedback
- Challenge assumptions

## My Commitment
- Update LEARNING_LOG.md after each session
- Make atomic git commits with descriptive messages
- Don't move forward without understanding
- Ask "why" when I don't understand
- Reflect on trade-offs before making decisions

## Current Phase
Week 1: Foundation & Code Quality

## Current Questions/Blockers
- How do I know if my code is "good enough" before moving to frameworks?
- What's the best order to learn: testing → Spring Boot → database, or different?
