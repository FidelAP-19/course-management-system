# Learning Log

## Week 1: [January 13-19, 2025]  ← Put actual dates

### What I'm Working On
- Setting up project structure and version control
- Creating Claude Project for mentorship
- Preparing for code audit and refactoring phase

### What I Learned
- Git basics: init, add, commit for version control
- How to structure a mentorship project with Claude
- The difference between Claude Projects and Claude Code
- 

### Challenges I Hit
- Understanding when to use Claude Projects vs Claude Code
- Git was new and slightly confusing at first
- Deciding how to structure project documentation

### Questions for My Mentor (Claude)
- What should be my first focus area in Week 1?
- How do I identify what makes code "portfolio-worthy"?
- What's the best approach to learning Spring Boot from scratch?

### Decisions I Made and Why
- Decided to use "Course Registration System" as my project narrative because it's more compelling than "school database"
- Set up Git from day 1 to establish professional habits early
- Created MENTORSHIP_GUIDELINES.md to maintain consistency across Claude Code sessions
